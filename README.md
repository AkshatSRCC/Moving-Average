# Moving-Average

In time series forecasting, a moving average process is used to predict long-term trends from the time series data while "smoothening out" short-term fluctuations. It addresses a crucial problem data science faces when dealing with time series data: differentiating spikes from an establishing trend.

Y(t) = μ + Є(t) +Q1Є(t-1)

Local linear regression (LLR) is an additional nonparametric statistical method that can be used to estimate a time series response variable. The LLR technique does not require a long time series for the development of a predictive model. In fact, the LLR technique can be utilized for prediction once three data points have been collected from the business process.
